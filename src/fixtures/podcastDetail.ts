        'If you’ve ever learned classical piano, you probably tried to play one of Bach’s Inventions. The composer wrote fifteen pieces containing the most important fifteen keys in order to teach his son the fundamentals of piano and composition. Today, they remain some of the most popular pieces of piano music. Acclaimed jazz pianist Dan Tepfer recently revisited his childhood music books seeing them in a way he’d never realized as a student: the Inventions are much more than novice piano works.\n\nFor Tepfer, each of the Inventions not only highlight masterful command over harmony and counterpoint, but also contain moving character arcs that resemble the hero’s journey. A character is introduced at home in place of safety in act I. And then they are thrust into chaos and must overcome unsurmountable challenges in Act II. Finally, in Act III, our hero overcomes their final battle and returns home transformed by the journey. Once Tepfer heard this character arc, he started to apply it to his own free improv.\n\nThrough studying Bach, Tepfer conceived a new album: Inventions / Reinventions. In this project Tepfer fills in the missing keys from the Bach to complete all twenty four keys (there are twelve major and twelve minor keys) while updating the music with modern improvisation. In this conversation Tepfer walks co-host Charlie Harding through his process of playing Bach and applying it to jazz improv.\n\nListen to Dan Tepfer’s Inventions / Reinventions on StorySound Records\nListen to Into It with Sam Sanders on Fair Use\nLearn more about your ad choices.

        'Everyone will describe the music of 100 gecs differently. To some, Dylan Brady and Laura Les make deeply satisfying earworms, tracks able to scratch the itches that occupy the deepest memory-holed corners of the brain. To others, though, their music is an "anarchic assault on the ears,” a quilt of all of the genres historically ridiculed in the popular canon: nu-metal, scuzz-rock, ska and 90’s pop punk are all fair game in the world of gecs.\n\nOn their latest record, aptly titled 10000 gecs, Brady and Les double down on the crunchy distortion and harmonics, creating tracks equally influenced by Primus and Eddie Van Halen as they are by their hyperpop contemporaries. The album reflects a Internet-core approach to music as a whole, shedding notions of “good” and “bad” music in favor of catchy melodies and intricate song construction. \n\nOn this episode on Switched On Pop, we dig deep into the ethos of 100 gecs, and producer Reanna Cruz talks to the duo themselves about their eclectic sophomore record.\n\nSongs discussed: \n\n\n100 gecs – Hollywood Baby\n\n100 gecs – Billy Knows Jamie\n\n100 gecs – stupid horse\n\n100 gecs – 745 sticky\n\n100 gecs – Doritos & Fritos\n\nPrimus – Jerry Was A Racecar Driver\n\nWeen – Bananas and Blow\n\nLimp Bizkit – My Generation\n\nGorillaz – Dirty Harry\n\nFuture – I Been Drinking\n\nJ-Kwon – Tipsy\n\nJustin Timberlake – Summer Love\n\nViolent Femmes – Added Up\n\n100 gecs – Dumbest Girl Alive\n\nTHX Deep Note\n\nCypress Hill – Insane in the Membrane\n\n100 gecs – The Most Wanted Person in the United States\n\n100 gecs – Frog on the Floor\n\nAlan Jackson – Chattahoochee\n\nLimp Bizkit – Dad Vibes\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

        '“Kiss From a Rose” is one of the most unusual number one hits of all time. Seal’s song can’t decide if it’s in minor or major, it uses an old-fashioned waltz rhythm, and its lush orchestration and elaborate vocal harmonies support mysterious lyrics about a “greying tower alone on the sea.” Seal himself wasn’t sure about the song, and needed some convincing to include the composition on his 1994 album SEAL II. But once director Joel Schumacher decided to use the track for the end credits of the film Batman Forever, the song went global and has remained a cultural phenomenon ever since. Ahead of his upcoming 30th anniversary tour for the albums SEAL I and SEAL II, we speak with the singer and songwriter about the enduring appeal of “Kiss From A Rose.”\nLearn more about your ad choices.

        "“Take Me Home, Country Roads” is a song about West Virginia, but its message of homecoming has resonance far beyond Appalachia. Songwriter and producer Ian Fitchuk found this out when he was requested to perform Denver’s music at a music festival in Tibet. Fitchuk discovered that Denver has a huge following in East and South East Asia, where Denver toured multiple times from the 70s through the 90s. Denver’s songs first came to the region through the US Armed Forces Network radio as well as a diplomatic performance for China’s leader Deng Xiaoping at the Kennedy Center in 1979. Denver performed alongside the Harlem Globetrotters and the Joffrey ballet, and he left such an impression, the show led to an invitation to be one of the first western musicians to tour China. To better understand Denver’s meaning in the region, Switched On Pop co-host Charlie Harding speaks with Ian Fitchuk about his performance and interviews journalist Jason Jeung who wrote about “Country Roads” in The Atlantic.\n\nSongs Discussed\n\nJohn Denver - Take Me Home, Country Roads\n\nKacey Musgraves - Oh, What A World\n\nThe East Is Red\n\nJohn Denver - Rocky Mountain High\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival - Fortunate Son\n\nJames Taylor - Carolina in My Mind\n\nCarpenters - (They Long To Be) Close To You\n\nJohn Denver - Thank God I'm a Country Boy\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

        "Five years ago, Los Angeles rapper Nipsey Hussle released Victory Lap, his only full length album. It was the high point of a career stretching back to the mid 2000s, when Hussle started releasing mixtapes on his own record label — mixtapes that brought him respect from artists like Jay-Z and Kendrick Lamar, but were not widely heard. \nVictory Lap brought him both the critical acclaim and commercial success he deserved — It hit #2 on the Billboard 200, and was nominated for a Grammy for Best Rap Album. But only a little over a year after its release, Hussle was shot to death outside his clothing store and community center in Crenshaw. In some ways, Hussle’s tragic end has overshadowed his incredible life as a musician and community activist.\nIn this conversation with Justin Tinsley, host of the podcast King of Crenshaw, we listen deeply to Victory Lap to hear Nipsey’s identity as an artist and consider the legacy of his debut album on its 5th anniversary.\nSongs Discussed\nNipsey Hussle - Victory Lap, Dedication, Hussle and Motivate, Last Time That I Checc'd, Real Big\nArctic Monkeys - Knee Socks\nJay-Z - Hard Knock Life\nSnoop Dogg - Y'all Gone Miss Me\nMore\nListen to the King of Crenshaw podcast.\nCheck out more of Justin's work\nLearn more about your ad choices.

        '“Flowers” by Miley Cyrus is spending another week on top of the Billboard 100 – quite fitting for Valentine’s Day.\n\nThe disco-country track has gotten people talking for a few reasons, but most notably, Cyrus invokes Bruno Mars’ classic “When I Was Your Man” in both lyrical and melodic allusions. The connection between the two songs is not one of interpolation, but rather, Miley is responding to Bruno’s hit through her own words: making “Flowers” an answer song. \n\nThis episode of Switched On Pop, we take a deeper look at “Flowers” and how it fits in the canon of response songs throughout history, from classics like “This Land is Your Land” to Nicki Minaj’s “Anaconda.” \n\nSongs Discussed: \n\nMiley Cyrus – Flowers\n\nKacey Musgraves – High Horse\n\nGloria Gaynor – I Will Survive\n\nDua Lipa – New Rules\n\nBruno Mars – When I Was Your Man\n\nEd Sheeran – Shape of You\n\nTLC – No Scrubs\n\nKaty Perry, Snoop Dogg – California Girls\n\nJAY-Z, Alicia Keys – Empire State of Mind\n\nBig Mama Thornton – Hound Dog\n\nRufus Thomas – Bear Cat\n\nHank Thompson – The Wild Side of Life\n\nKitty Wells – It Wasn’t God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels\n\nRay Charles – Hit the Road, Jack\n\nNina Simone – Come on Back Jack\n\nThe Chantels – Well, I Told You\n\nUTFO – Roxanne, Roxanne\n\nRoxanne Shanté – Roxanne’s Revenge\n\nUTFO – The Real Roxanne\n\nNew Edition – Candy Girl\n\nThe Jackson 5 – ABC\n\nSir Mix-A-Lot – Baby Got Back\n\nNicki Minaj – Anaconda\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

        'In 2010, a photographer named Reuben Cox moved to Los Angeles to start Old Style Guitar Shop. In the years since, the instruments that he continues to repair and sell have come to define the sound of the LA indie folk scene among artists like Blake Mills, Andrew Bird, Madison Cunningham, Ethan Gruska and Phoebe Bridgers.\n\nReuben’s guitars are Frankenstein-esque creations, cobbled together from spare parts and neglected guitar bodies found in flea markets and estate sales. The sounds that these make, though, are as eccentric as their source: the strings are laid on top of Reuben’s signature, a rubber bridge.\n\nThis sound, and the mythos of the rubber bridge guitar, has turned Reuben into a local celebrity and put Old Style at the center of Los Angeles’s indie music scene. In this episode of Switched on Pop, host Charlie Harding explores that sound and the man behind it all.\n\nSongs Discussed (playlist)\n\nTaylor Swift - champagne problems\n\nOlivia Rodrigo - hope ur ok\n\nboygenius - Emily I’m Sorry\n\nJenny Owen Youngs - Vampire Weeknight\n\nAndrew Bird - The New Saint Jude\n\nMarcus Mumford - Only Child\n\nPerfume Genius - Slip Away\n\nAndrew Bird - Underlands\n\nMadison Cunningham - Anywhere\n\nMadison Cunningham - Life According to Raechel\n\nPhoebe Bridgers - Garden Song\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

        'In 1988, Bobby McFerrin recorded a song a cappella with a simple message: not to worry, and just enjoy life. That song, aptly titled “Don’t Worry, Be Happy,” topped the charts and become one of the most well known one-hit wonders of all time. \n\nIn doing so, it also propelled McFerrin into the spotlight, winning him three Grammy awards and an eternal place in pop culture. His career, though, is more than just the Big Mouth Billy Bass: a deep dive reveals an incredible career in jazz, folk, and classical music as well as a remarkable command of his own voice. This episode of Switched on Pop, we explore the history behind "Don\'t Worry, Be Happy" and the ensuing legacy of Bobby McFerrin.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

        'Over the past few months, you may have heard your favorite song pop up on the Internet – just slightly faster. You’re not alone: the phenomenon of the “sped-up” remix has taken over social media, with everyone from Lady Gaga to Thundercat getting the tempo treatment.

Ever since the proliferation of these “remixes,” the big questions remain: where did these songs come from and why are they here? \n\nOn this episode of Switched on Pop, we explore this exact phenomenon, tracing its roots from Thomas Edison to Cam’ron to vaporwave to nightcore.\n\nSongs Discussed:\n\n\n“Dream On” – Aerosmith (sped up)\n\n“Escapism” – RAYE, 070 Shake (sped up)\n\n“Bad Habit” – Steve Lacy (sped up)\n\n“Miss You” – Oliver Tree (sped up)\n\n“Say It Right” – Nelly Furtado (sped up)\n\n“Bloody Mary” – Lady Gaga (sped up)\n\n“Heat Waves” – Glass Animals (slowed down)\n\n“Juicy” – Notorious B.I.G. \n\n“Juicy” – DJ Screw\n\n“Jolene” – Dolly Parton (slowed down)\n\n“リサフランク420 / 現代のコンピュー |” – Macintosh Plus\n\n“In Da Club Before Eleven O’ Clock” – DJ Rashad\n\n“Monster [Nightcore]” – Meg & Dia, remixed by Barren Gates \n\n“Concrete Angel” – Hannah Diamond\n\n“Witch Doctor” – David Seville\n\n“Oh Boy” – Cam’ron, Juelz Santana\n\n“Cool for the Summer” – Demi Lovato (sped up)\n\n“Them Changes” – Thundercat (sped up & Chopnotslop remix)\n\n“That’s All” – Genesis\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

        'Matt Daniels, editor of the publication The Pudding, wanted to find out what songs from his youth would last into the future. So he designed a study that would test if Gen-Z had a grip on 90s culture. Hundreds of thousands of participants provided over 3 million data points. Daniels parsed through the data for insights. Sadly, the majority of his most beloved songs have not survived even one generation. Though most had been forgotten, he found that just a few songs had staying power across generations — what he defined as the emerging 90s music canon. Find out what songs make it and which have fallen to the wayside. \n\nMORE\nThe Pudding’s study on Defining the 90s Canon\nTake The Pudding’s quiz yourself\n\nSONGS DISCUSSED\nSpice Girls - Wannabe \nMariah Carey - Fantasy!\nLou Bega - Mambo #5\nLos Del Rio - Macarena\nBoys II Men - Motown Philly\nWhitney Houston - I Will Always Love You\nSavage Garden - I Want You\nThe Barenaked Ladies - One Week\nJewel - You Were Meant For Me\nJennifer Lopez - If You Had My Love\nCeline Dion - My Heart Will Go On\nBritney Spears - Baby One More Time\nSmash Mouth - All Star\nNirvana - Smells Like Teen Spirit\nLearn more about your ad choices.

        "The number one song on the charts is a bit of a mystery. “We Don’t Talk About Bruno” is the unlikely hit from Disney’s sleeper animated musical Encanto. Set in a mountainous village in Colombia, the film was a middling commercial success when it was released in Nov 2021. But in recent months it has become a pop culture phenomenon for a confluence of reasons: an expansive discourse on Colombian representation in media, fan videos on TikTok, and of course it's ear-wormy hits. \nThe musical is yet another notch in the belt for Lin Manuel Miranda (the auteur behind Hamilton and In The Heights) who wrote the now chart-topping song book. While Disney certainly commands vast commercial success, its musicals rarely see such crossover attention. The last #1 Disney musical number was “A Whole New World” from the animated Aladdin back in 1993. Where that song was literally uplifting, “We Don’t Talk About Bruno” is quite the opposite. \nBruno is the uncle of the Madrigal family, whose skill for seeing the future portends gloom and sends him into exile. In his namesake song “We Don’t Talk About Bruno,” an ensemble cast trade verses about his ghostly presence (Bruno haunts the family home, living inside its walls). It is an odd ball song, with dark and bizarre lyrics. Sure it starts with a story about rain on a wedding day (which is not ironic), but then it takes a hard left into tales of dead fish, middle aged weight gain, and creeping rats. So then what makes it a hit? A distinctive concoction of salsa piano rhythms, familiar Lin Manuel Miranda-isms, and contemporary pop connections to Camila Cabello, Britney Spears, J Balvin, Bad Bunny and Cardi B. \nListen to Switched On Pop to solve the mystery of what makes “We Don’t Talk About Bruno” a hit. \n\nSONGS DISCUSSED\nLin Manuel Miranda - We Don’t Talk About Bruno, In The Heights, Helpless, Satisfied, My Shot, Wait For It, Say No To This\nCardi B, J Balvin, I Like It\nLuis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee - Despacito\nCamila Cabello, Young Thug - Havana\nBritney Spears - Baby One More Time\nLearn more about your ad choices.

        'When it comes to distinguishing what exactly Latin music is, what makes the cut? To some, it’s simply music from the Latin American region, and to others, it’s any music that is sung in Spanish – but much like the pop canon, the phrase encapsulates so many different eras, styles, and genres.\n\nLike any distinction, there’s also music on the periphery: specifically, the music of Brazil, where the sounds are similar but the main language is different, and Spain, where the history of colonization looms over the country’s relationship with Latin America, raising controversial questions of appropriation. \n\nNonetheless though, music from both countries has made big waves amongst U.S. listeners on Latin radio stations and at award shows. Anitta’s record Versions of Me has been finding success on streaming and the radio, while Rosalía’s MOTOMAMI has become one of the most acclaimed records of the year, winning this year’s Album of the Year award at the Latin Grammys. This episode of Switched on Pop, we take a look at these artists and how they incorporate both native and Latin sounds in their tracks.\n\nVote for the Signal Awards: https://vote.signalaward.com/PublicVoting#/2022/shows/general/music\n\nSONGS DISCUSSED: \n\nAnitta – Girl From Rio\n\nRosalía – DESPECHÁ\n\nAnitta, Ty Dolla $ign – Gimme Your Number\n\nMC Marcinho, DJ Marlboro – Glamourosa (Rap Glamurosa)\n\nM.I.A. – Bucky Done Gun\n\nAnitta, Papatinho, MC Kevin o Chris, Mr. Catra, YG – Que Rabão\n\nAnitta – Envolver\n\nKarol G – PROVENZA\n\nRosalía – MALAMENTE - Cap.1: Augurio\n\nRosalía – BULERÍAS\n\nRosalía – DELIRIO DE GRANDEZA\n\nJusto Betancourt – Delirio De Grandeza\n\nTego Calderon – Al Natural\n\nRosalía – SAOKO\n\nWisin, Daddy Yankee – Saoco\n\nRosalía – CHICKEN TERIYAKI\n\nRosalía – DIABLO\n\nRosalía, TOKISCHA – LA COMBI VERSACE\n\nRosalía, The Weeknd – La Fama\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

        'For Switched On Pop’s end of year coverage, we just have one superlative: who won 2022? The answer, of course, is Bad Bunny. This year alone, the prolific Puerto Rican artist has topped charts worldwide, became Spotify’s most streamed artist globally, and his record Un Verano Sin Ti has obtained many accolades including being the first Spanish-language album nominated for Album of the Year at the Grammys.\n\nThe record itself serves as a textbook to the sounds of Latin America: over the course of 23 songs, we’re introduced to bachata, dembow, cumbia, merengue, bomba, and of course, reggaeton. This episode, alongside LA Times journalist Suzy Exposito, we unpack Un Verano Sin Ti and why the album is so important, both for Bad Bunny and the Latin diaspora.\n\nVote for the Signal Awards: https://vote.signalaward.com/PublicVoting#/2022/shows/general/music\n\nSongs Discussed:\n\n\nBad Bunny – Callaita\n\nBad Bunny – Diles\n\nCardi B, Bad Bunny, J Balvin – I Like It\n\nN.O.R.E., Daddy Yankee, Nina Sky, Gemstar, Big Mato – Oye Mi Canto\n\nRuben Blades – Plástico\n\nBad Bunny – Después de la Playa\n\nBad Bunny – Tití Me Preguntó\n\nBad Bunny – El Apagón\n\nHéctor Lavoe, Fania All Stars – Mi Gente - Live\n\nOmega – Si Te Vas\n\nAventura, Don Omar – Ella Y Yo\n\nNando Boom – Ellos Benia Dem Bow\n\nDaddy Yankee – Gasolina\n\nEl General – Tu Pun Pun\n\nShabba Ranks – Dem Bow\n\nEl Alfa, CJ, Chael Produciendo, El Cherry Scom – La Mamá de la Mamá\n\nBad Bunny – Me Fui de Vacaciones\n\nBad Bunny, Bomba Estéreo – Ojitos Lindos\n\nStan Getz, João Gilberto, Astrud Gilberto – The Girl From Ipanema\n\nBad Bunny – Si Veo a Tu Mamá\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
